"""
EZ Maintenance++ : one uniform dialog / progress / copy / restart surface.

Every backup / restore / compress / extract / upload / download path in this add-on
used to hand-roll its own DialogProgress, its own cancel check, its own "Please wait"
string, its own restart mechanism, and its own network copy. The paths drifted: some
had a download gauge but no restore gauge, some cancelled cleanly and some bricked the
box, some named the add-on "Maintenance" and some "EZ Maintenance++". This module is the
single place all of that lives so every path behaves identically.

Design rules (enforced by test_ui.py):
  * Imports ONLY xbmc / xbmcaddon / xbmcgui / xbmcvfs, so it is fully unit-testable
    off-device.
  * `Progress` is ONE class with two body formatters (`bytes`, `items`) - never split.
    The divide-by-zero guard lives INSIDE it, so no caller can reintroduce the
    empty-folder ZeroDivisionError. `cancelled()` is memoised + idempotent.
  * `copy_with_progress` is atomic (temp + rename), checks `write()`'s bool return,
    validates size after close, cleans its partial on ANY non-success exit, and falls
    back to a second, unchunked copy attempt (itself size-verified, same settle-poll
    as the chunked path) on a transient failure OR a chunked copy whose size never
    settles, NEVER on cancel.
  * A LOCAL source path (no "://") is read with plain Python `open()`, never
    `xbmcvfs.File`/`xbmcvfs.copy` - live-confirmed on tvOS: reading a just-built
    local temp zip via EITHER `File(src, "r").readBytes()` OR the opaque
    `xbmcvfs.copy()` comes back completely empty on every call, despite
    `xbmcvfs.Stat()` correctly reporting its size, so the bug is not which VFS
    entry point is used - Kodi's VFS read of this sandboxed local file is broken
    full stop. This add-on's own `CreateZip()` writes that same file with plain
    `zipfile`/`open()`, and `wiz.py`'s staged-zip validation already reads it back
    with plain `os.path.getsize()`/`zipfile.is_zipfile()` - so plain Python I/O is
    proven to work for this exact path on this exact device; only Kodi's own VFS
    read of it is broken. A remote source (nfs://, smb://, ...) still goes through
    `xbmcvfs.File`, since plain Python can't read a VFS URL - the bug is specific
    to local sandboxed reads, not remote ones.
  * `copy_with_progress` retries a definitive `VfsCopyError` up to `COPY_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`
    times with a `COPY_RETRY_DELAY_SECS` pause between tries (never on cancel). Kodi's
    NFS/SMB client can leave a connection stale after its own idle-close reaper fires
    (observed: instant `VfsCopyError` on the very next write after "NFS is idle,
    closing the remaining connections"); an immediate in-process retry reuses the same
    broken connection object and fails identically, but a short pause gives Kodi's VFS
    layer room to open a genuinely fresh one, and the next attempt succeeds.
  * One heading (`HEADING`), one restart (`Quit`).

    On Fire TV / Android, Kodi CANNOT restart itself - `RestartApp` is desktop-only, so

    closes). So on Android we say "close now, then reopen Kodi"; on desktop, where Quit
    does relaunch cleanly, we say "restart".

    `status` is an optional line shown above the prompt (e.g. "Restore Complete: ...").
    Returns True and acts (Quit) if the user accepts. Callers on the post-wipe path MUST
    always reach this, even after a partial restore.
